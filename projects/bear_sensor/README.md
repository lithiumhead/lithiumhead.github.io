Bear Sensor
===========

My friend Kirti Chavan working to conserve the Himalayan Brown Bear in Zanskar, Ladakh. We are trying out different ways to detect when a bear is trying to enter houses in search of food. Idea is to alert the humans or scare the bear away and avoid human-animal conflicts. We will work on putting together simple electronic circuits and Kirti will test drive them out in the field to see which one works best and is easy to maintain.
