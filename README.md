My blog and repo for DIY Projects
=================================

This repository serves two purposes:

  1. It powers my blog [diy.lithiumhead.com](https://diy.lithiumhead.com).
  2. It holds the source code and designs for projects that I make.

My blog describes various DIY (Do-It-Yourself) projects that put together (or pulled apart)
over weekends (or while slacking from work).


I live in India
---------------

And so you will find that I write in Hinglish. My aim is to create a niche for the young Indian junta graduating in hoards from engineering colleges here. So if you are one of those bacchas who gets to hear your mom taunt you with "char saal engineering padhne ke baad bhi tubelight badalna nahin aata?", then this is not the place for you - Pehle tubelight badal na seekh ke aao (and fix a leaking tap, a broken switch etc), and agar majja aaya and uske baad bhi khujli bacchi ho, tab you are welcome here to learn to build things and graduate to "pata nahin kya kya banate rehta hai, ek din pure ghar mein circuits and taarein hi latak rahi hongi and hamare chalne ki jagah nahin bachegi".


Living in India has its own quirks and constraints. Walls are made of conrete. Toh sirf hammer nahin, poora drill machine is needed to hang/install stuff. You don't have huge DIY store chains, toh local harware wale se kaam chalana padega (or amazon, if you know the name of the thing you want). No garage (we live in apartments) toh carpentry toh bhul hi jaao, the mx space you will get is whatever remains most of it is occupied by the double bed in your room ("arre koi guest aaye toh jagah toh honi chahiye na!" - yup! you will find typical North Indian mom lines all over the place)

But I reserve my "Indianess" only for my blog posts. I will try to keep project READMEs devoid of Hinglish and local references.

Projects
--------

Usually they are of 4 kinds:

  1. I figured out how to do X-Y-Z and put together a kind of "For Dummies" guide full of steps you can blindly follow.
  2. I opened up an existing device and figured out how it works or how to get it to do something new.
  3. Internet of Things projects using Raspberry Pi or Arduino or something similar.
  4. Projects that simultaneously involve all of the above - figure out how to do X, hack it together with Y and splice it with a new circuit to do Z

Folders
